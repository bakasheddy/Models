# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Greetings! My name is Shedrack David, and I am a data analyst. Some people say that analyzing data is boring, but for me, it is like trying to solve a mystery, and I love a good puzzle! I spend most of my days poring over spreadsheets, charts, and graphs, looking for insights and patterns that others might miss. But when I am not working, you can find me indulging in some of my other passions. For instance, I love listening to music. I believe that music can soothe the soul and inspire creativity, and it is also a great way to take a break from the grind. Another way I like to unwind is by watching documentaries and podcasts about philosophy, cosmology, and data science. I find these topics fascinating because they help me understand the universe and our place in it. Plus, it is always fun to nerd out with like-minded people! When I am not exploring the mysteries of the universe, you might find me playing video games or watching anime. I know, I know - some people might say that video games and anime are just for kids. But I believe that there is something special about being able to lose yourself in a fictional world, whether you are saving a princess or battling giant robots. So if you ever need to like talk about any of these topics or about life in general, feel free to reachout😊
