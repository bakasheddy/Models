# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Greetings, my dear reader! My name is Shedrack David, and I am a data analyst by profession. Some people say that analyzing data is boring, but for me, it's like trying to solve a mystery, and I love a good puzzle! I spend most of my days poring over spreadsheets, charts, and graphs, looking for insights and patterns that others might miss.

But when I'm not working, you can find me indulging in some of my other passions. For instance, I love listening to music. I believe that music can soothe the soul and inspire creativity, and it's also a great way to take a break from the grind.

Another way I like to unwind is by watching documentaries and podcasts about philosophy, cosmology, and data science. I find these topics fascinating because they help me understand the universe and our place in it. Plus, it's always fun to nerd out with like-minded people!

When I'm not exploring the mysteries of the universe, you might find me playing video games or watching anime. I know, I know - some people might say that video games and anime are just for kids. But I believe that there's something special about being able to lose yourself in a fictional world, whether you're saving a princess or battling giant robots.
So if you ever need to like talk about any of these topics or about life in general, feel free to reachoutðŸ˜Š
