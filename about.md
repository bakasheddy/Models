*Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Scientist | ML/AI Enthusiast*

Hi there!, again. I'm Shedrack David, and I'm a Data Analyst. I have a passion for may technologies like Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and I love using data to uncover insights and solve complex problems.

When I'm not busy crunching numbers and analyzing data, you can usually find me learning about cosmology or listening to music. I find that these are a perfect way to unwind and clear my head after a long day of work.

Speaking of work, I've had the pleasure of working with some amazing companies and clients over the years. My expertise in Data Analysis has allowed me to meet and work with some amazing people i really respect, which is something I'm really proud of.

But enough about work! Let's talk about the fun stuff. In my free time, I enjoy  playing video games, watching documentries or anime. 
Now, I know what you're thinking. "Wow, this person is pretty impressive. But are they also fun to be around?" Well, I'll let you be the judge of that. But I will say this: I like to think I have a good sense of humor, and I'm always up for a good laugh. So if you ever want to chat about data, cosmology, games, anime, physics and philosophy, or just life in general, feel free to reach out!
