  description: 'The BikeFlow project is a comprehensive analysis of the FordGo regional public bicycle sharing system in California''s San Francisco Bay Area. Using a dataset of over 2 million data points, the project aims to uncover usage patterns between the different user groups of the bike sharing system. The analysis seeks to answer two important questions: when are most trips taken in terms of time of day or month of the year, and how long does the average trip take? Additionally, the project examines how trip duration is affected by whether the user is a subscriber or a customer, shedding light on the behavior of these distinct user groups. By analyzing the data and uncovering insights into usage patterns, the project offers valuable insights into the FordGo bicycle sharing system, which can be used to inform decisions related to system optimization and user experience. Overall, the GoData project provides a thorough and rigorous analysis of bike sharing usage in the San Francisco Bay Area, demonstrating the power of data analytics to drive insights and inform real-world decisions.'

To achieve this, a dataset of approximately 10,000 movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) was downloaded from Udacity Project 1 course. The project involved analyzing the dataset using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and time series analysis to identify features strongly correlated with high revenue and the popularity of different movie genres over time.'
